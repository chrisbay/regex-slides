# Regular Expressions

---

## What Are Regular Expressions?

- A pattern-matching language for testing strings
--

- Given a pattern (e.g. "contains two digits"), does a given string match the pattern?
--

- Most language provide regex tools that allow a programmer to do things with regexex and matched strings 
--

- We'll use JavaScript, but the same broad concepts apply to other languages, and regex syntax is similar from one language to another

# JS Regex Syntax 

---

## Basics

In JS, a regular expression can be created as a literal by encolosing the pattern in `/` characters 

```
let myRegex = / /* pattern */ /;
```

If a string contains a substring that conforms to the pattern, we say it "matches" the substring (or, lazily, that it matches the string itself)

--

**Example**

`/Java/` matches `"JavaScript"`

---

## Character Sets 

Character sets use `[ ]` to define a collection of characters to match

--

- `/[abc]/` matches `"apple"` but not `"Apple"` or `"dog"`

--

- `/[abc][def]d/` matches `"add"` and `"bed"` but not `"dad"`

--

Negate a character class with `^`

--

-  `/[^abc]/` matches `"apple"` and `"dog"` but not `"a"`

---

## Ranges 

We can define ranges within a character set 

--

- `[a-z]` is the set of all lowercase letters 

--

- `[0-9]` is the set of digits 

--

- `[a-zA-Z0-9]` is the set of all alphanumeric characters 

---

## Character classes

Some commonly-used character sets have **character classes**, which are shorthands for various sets of the form `\x`, where `x` is one of a handful of recognized letters. 

--

- `\d` is the set of all digits 
--


- `\w` is the set of all "word characters" (letters, numbers, and underscore)
--

- `\s` is the set of all whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, etc)

--

We can use the negated form of a character class by capitalizing its assigned letter. E.g. `\S` is the set of all *non*-whitespace characters.

--

The meta-character `.` can be thought of as a character class or set that matches *any* character (e.g. `/a.b/`)

---

## Quantifiers 

Quantifiers allow us to specify that a portion of a regex can be repeated some number of times to constitute a match.

--

- `*` - zero or more times 
    - `/dog*/` matches `"dog"`, `"do"`, and `"doggo"`
--

- `+` - one or more times 
    - `/dog+/` matches `"dog"` and `"doggo"` but not `"do"`
--

- `?` - zero or one times (i.e. "optional")
    - `/dog?/` matches `"dog"`, `"do"`, and `"door"`

---

## More quantifiers 


The quantifier `{n,m}` specifies that a portion must be repeated between `n` and `m` times. Both integers are optional.

--

- `/dog{1,2}/` matches `"dog"` and `"doggo"` but not `"do"` or `"doggggo"`
--

- `/dog{2,}/` matches `"doggo"` and `"doggggo"` but not `"dog"`

---

## Boundaries 

There are two special characters that match the beginning (`^`) and end (`$`) of a string 

--

- `/^Code/` matches `"Code Club"` but not `"LaunchCode"`

--

- `/Code$/` matches `"LaunchCode"` but not `"Code Club"`

--

- `/^Code$/` matches only `"Code"` (a "full string" match)

---

## Groups 

We can group portions of a regex using parens, `( )`, in order to apply quantifiers to a subexpression, or to "capture" matches of the subexpression (more on this later)

--

- `/(ab.*)+/` matches `"abracadabra"`, `"abs"`, and `"abababab"`


---

## Flags 

We can use *flags* to turn on optional behavior for a regex. A flag is a letter that goes after the second `/`.

--

`i` - carry out a case-insensitive search 

`g` - carry out a global search (i.e. search for all occurences of a pattern)


---

## JavaScript Regex Methods 

### Search / validate
- `String.prototype.search()` / [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/search) / Does the string look like we expect?
- `String.prototype.match()` / [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match) / Which parts of the string look like we expect?

--

### Replace / transform

- `String.prototype.replace()`  / [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) / Replace matches with a new substring 


---

## Example - Phone Number Validation 

What are valid US phone number formats that you would expect a user to be able to enter into an app? 

We will create a pattern to match *all* of them!
