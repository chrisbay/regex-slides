# HowTo: Writing

To start writing your own slide deck in MarkDown, simply open the HTML file in your editor of choice and make changes as you wish. You can find all the places that you should edit by searching for the '#ToDo' hashtag inside the HTML file. Here are the different places in detail:

1. Write your presentation's title in the 'title' tag of the 'head' section
2. Set '16:9' or '4:3' dimensions in the body.onload JavaScript
3. Write your slides in MarkDown as shown in the examples
4. Be inspiring!

# Note on Customizing

If placing slides in a subdirectory (which is recommended for larger collections of presentations), update the location of JS and CSS files in the template:

```html
<!-- in the head -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/slidestyles.css" type="text/css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">

<!-- before the closing body tag -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/remark-latest.min.js"></script>
```

</textarea>

<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/remark-latest.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
